## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. 

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do these challenges, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and (sometimes) JavaScript.**

## Where to find everything

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. I Would find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. The reason for this, as opposed to including Sketch (or other similar design software) files, is to help train your eye when developing. This will mean that I'll need to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help when i am working on real projects, but do have access to full design files.

Once downloaded the challenge resources file, one would find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information one will need, such as color palette and fonts.
